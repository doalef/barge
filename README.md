# barge
React Native app for saving your memories with ease i guess :/

## What is a Unierr Free Style? 
We don't have much time on our hands to create huge and complicated apps, 
So we create these little cute apps in between our projects and publish it under
Unierr label to help the app grow(and show off our skills :)) jk of course). 

## Compatibilty? 
The app should work just fine in the android 4.2 and above. I wasn't in the mood to check the rest. 
If you have to much time on your hand or you're just stupid you can  test other versions and sunmit an issue it would be highly appreciated. :D

## Why? 
Idk to be honest. 

## Where is it going? 
Barge is currently an offline notepad-ish app but with enough time i'm gonna add backup ability and add journal like exports.
And last but not least it's gonna become a social media around your memories. 

## Does it work on my iphone? 
Hell no, fuck ios. 

## About the tech
The app is built with reacr native and it's using javascript to turn your code into something that makes sense. 
And it's using Realm to store your data. 
Why realm? Beacuse it's a fast no-sql easy to use and setup database. 

## Setting up development enviromemt

First of all you need android sdk, nodejs and android studio installed

After you installed `nodejs` run:
`npm i - g react-native-cli`

You need an avd device you can make one in android studio, google it i ain't got time for this shit. 

After you started your avd you can biuld and install the app on your device with:
`react-native run-android`

If you just need the packager just run:
`react-native start`

After you finished crapping all over my code and want to bundle your code kust run
`npm run bundle`

And that's it. 

Any bugs or problems reports are apreciated.
